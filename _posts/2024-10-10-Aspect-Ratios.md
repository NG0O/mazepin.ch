## Most Common Aspect Ratios

### 4:3 / 1.33:1

4:3 was primarily used in the past as it represents a frame from a 35mm film. Today, it is used only as a stylistic choice, causing black bars on the left and right sides of the screen.

**Movies in 4:3:**  
- How the West Was Won (1962)  
- The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) (partially in 4:3)

### 16:9 / 1.77:1

This is now the standard TV format, a compromise between 4:3 and 21:9. Most cinema films are not shot in 16:9.

**Movies in 16:9:**  
- Monsters, Inc. (2001)  
- Various TV shows

### 1.85:1

1.85:1 is slightly wider than 16:9 and is often used in cinema films. It fits well on TVs but still looks more cinematic than 16:9.

**Movies in 1.85:1:**  
- The Lion King (2019)  
- Wolkenbruch (2018)

### 2.35:1 / 21:9

21:9 is commonly used for cinema films. In the past, this ratio was achieved using anamorphic lenses to compress the image. Today, it's still popular because it looks "epic."

**Movies in 2.35:1:**  
- Inception (2010)  
- Drive (2011)

- 007 No Time to Die (2021)  
- Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)
